# senior-thesis
Senior Thesis in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Vermont. Computer fluid dynamics and optimization contents - along other related stuff that interests me. This will keep track of the content of the folders and what is done inside each code. Mostly Python and OpenFOAM codes - although some MATLAB (...) could appear. Eventually this README.md file will become an ordered summary of all the work related to this topic.
 
## 12-steps-CFD
These are the notebooks from the Lorena A. Barba course "*12 steps to CFD*" in Python. They have different stuff from other pages as well as the main equations written on them.
