# senior-thesis
Senior Thesis in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Vermont. Computer fluid dynamics and optimization contents - along other related stuff that interests me. This will keep track of the content of the folders and what is done inside each code. Mostly Python and OpenFOAM codes - although some MATLAB (...) could appear. Eventually this README.md file will become an ordered summary of all the work related to this topic.
 
## 12-steps-CFD
These are the notebooks from the Lorena A. Barba course "*12 steps to CFD*" in Python. They have different stuff from other pages as well as the main equations written on them.


## airfoil-parametrization
In the way of searching a way of correctly parametrize airfoils, different models have been analyzed so far. One of them is the typical NACA 4-digit equations (more info at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA_airfoil>), obtaining the plot of the selected airfoil and a list of points to further pre-processing. Some meshing with this airfoil is attempted - no major success so far. Another option is the Joukowsky transform (more info at <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joukowsky_transform>), the same process as in the CHMYukovski program, done in previous courses (<https://github.com/jlobatop/CHMYukovski>).
